## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or replace components.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep your movement logic distinct from other game systems.
- **Scalability**: Adapt the framework as your game grows.
- **Input System Integration**: Seamlessly work with Unity's input system.
- **OOP Principles**: Follow best practices for object-oriented programming.
- **MVC Pattern**: Utilize the Model-View-Controller pattern for clear organization.

## Getting Started

To start using the **CharacterMovement2D** framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the package into your Unity project.
3. Set up your character controller using the provided examples.

## Installation

You can download the latest release from our [Releases](https://github.com/Danizolo/CharacterMovement2D/releases) section. Make sure to execute the downloaded files as per the instructions provided.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Danizolo/CharacterMovement2D.git
   ```

2. **Open Unity**: Launch your Unity Editor.

3. **Import Package**:
   - Go to `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package...`
   - Select the downloaded package file.

4. **Setup Your Scene**:
   - Drag and drop the character prefab into your scene.
   - Adjust settings in the Inspector as needed.

## Usage

To utilize the **CharacterMovement2D** framework, follow these guidelines:

### Basic Movement

1. **Attach the Movement Script**: Attach the movement script to your character GameObject.
2. **Configure Input**: Set up your input actions through Unity's Input System.
3. **Test Movement**: Press play and use the assigned keys to move your character.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to set up basic movement:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    private CharacterMovement characterMovement;

    void Start()
    {
        characterMovement = GetComponent<CharacterMovement>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveY = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        characterMovement.Move(new Vector2(moveX, moveY));
    }
}
```

## Architecture

The architecture of **CharacterMovement2D** is built around several core principles:

### Modular Design

Each component serves a specific purpose, allowing for easy replacement or enhancement. This design pattern promotes clean code and makes debugging simpler.

### Separation of Concerns

The framework separates input handling, movement logic, and character state management. This makes it easier to maintain and extend each part independently.

### MVC Pattern

The Model-View-Controller pattern helps in organizing code effectively. It separates the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the logic (Controller).
